# TODO (HIGH) speed up this case, simplified cases are:
# 	((A & (X & Y)) = 0)
# 	(( (A & (X & Y)) + (B & (X & Y'))) = 0)
# the problems start with the following case:
# 	((( (A & (X & Y)) + (B & (X & Y')) ) + (C & (X' & Y))) = 0)
# The issue seems to be related to dnf conversion that takes to long.
#
((((( A & X ) & Y)+((B & X) & Y))+((( C & X') & Y)+(( D & X') & Y'))) = 0)
